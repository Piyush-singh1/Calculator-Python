# Simple Calculator in Python

## Description
This project is a simple Python-based calculator that enables users to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program handles user input validation, ensures error-free calculations (e.g., prevents division by zero), and offers a straightforward interface for repeated use.

## Features
- Perform the following arithmetic operations:
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Division (`/`)
- Validates user input to avoid crashes or errors.
- Handles division by zero gracefully with error messages.
- Allows multiple calculations in a single session.

## How to Use
1. Run the program in a Python environment:
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
